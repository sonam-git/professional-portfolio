# Professional-Portfolio
The main purpose of this project is to tackle the challange to create your own portfolio using the HTML & CSS skills and knowledge you learned 
from the class.
# Description
A portfolio of work can showcase your skills and talents to employers looking to fill a part-time or full-time position. 
An effective portfolio highlights your strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios
with deployed web applications (meaning they are live on the web) are typically very successful in their career search after the boot camp.
# Motivation
The one thing it motivates you is working on the thing you need most in your career, and you are working on it using the knowledge and skill you learn.
# Technologies used

a better way. Your suggestions and feedbacks are highly appreciated.
